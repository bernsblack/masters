# TODO List for the project

In `dev.py`:

- [ ] REFACTOR function: compare_time_series_metrics
- [ ] save trained baseline models and trained metrics to own folder...
- [ ] load baseline models...save evaluation metrics to own folder...
- [ ] all models have the same length of test set - the sequence needed should be incorporated into the loaders
- [ ] compare_time_series_metrics functions should actually just load metrics of each model and compare using latex and
  plots and save the result in a directory
- [ ] look at the grid metrics - we need meta information about the start adn stop times - can even have the results
  saved - look at grid result as an example
